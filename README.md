# HelpMePLZ

I created this project to study logging. But I can't execute it, here's the mistake by my intelliJ IDEA:

2
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (Sample).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.

It means that it cannot find the property file, but log4j2.properties is locates in src folder.
By the way, I plugged in the library (see pic.1).

What do I do wrong?
